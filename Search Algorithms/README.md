### Task-based Guidelines

- For 1 Source -> 1 Destination? Use... - A\* Search Algorithm
- For 1 Source -> N Destination? Use... - BFS (for unweighted graphs) - Dijkstra's greedy algorithm (for weighted graphs w/o negative weights) - Bellman-Ford's dynamic programming algorithm (for weighted graphs w/negative weights)
- Between every pair of nodes? Use... - Floyd-Warshall's dynamic programming algorithm - Johnson's Algorithm
