### Task-based Guidelines
- For 1 Source -> 1 Destination? Use...
	- A* Search Algorithm
- For 1 Source -> N Destination? Use...
	- BFS (for unweighted graphs)
	- Dijkstra (for weighted graphs w/o negative weights)
	- Bellman-Ford (for weighted graphs w/negative weights)
- Between every pair of nodes? Use...
	- Floyd-Warshall
	- Johnson's Algorithm
